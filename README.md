This software was written for the course 'Fysica van Moderne Technology
' (Physcis of Modern Technology) thought by Dr. W. Loeffler at Leiden
 university. The software is inspired by materials presented during the
  lectures. It is written by Jibbe Reuver and me (Julian van Doorn). 
  
The software uses the Python library `tmm` to simulate a Bragg reflector. The
 variables can be adjusted in the file `fmt.py` which is also the main file
  to run.
